<h1>We live on a planet called Earth that is part of our solar system. But where is our solar system? Itâ€™s a small part of the Milky Way Galaxy.

  A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and  of stars and their solar systems. A galaxy is held together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a  in the middle.

    <h1>A galaxy is a vast and awe-inspiring cosmic structure composed of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. These celestial islands are held together by gravity, forming intricate systems that span immense distances in the universe. Letâ€™s explore more about galaxies: </h1>
<p>Milky Way: Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, contains our Solar System. It stretches approximately 100,000 light-years across and harbors an estimated 100 billion stars. In Greek mythology, the Milky Way was born from spilled divine milk when Hera discovered she was nursing an unknown babyâ€”hence its name 1.</p>
<h3>  Types of Galaxies:
    Elliptical Galaxies: These galaxies have an elliptical shape and contain older stars. They lack the spiral arms seen in other types.
    Spiral Galaxies: The Milky Way is an example of a spiral galaxy. These galaxies exhibit beautiful spiral arms, where young stars form.
    Irregular Galaxies: Irregular in shape, these galaxies lack a well-defined structure and can be chaotic or distorted.</h3> 
    <h2> Cosmic Web: Galaxies arenâ€™t randomly scattered. Instead, they align along unimaginably long filaments, creating a cosmic web of interconnected star cities. These associations form groups, clusters, and superclusters, with immense voids in between</h2>
    <h2>
      When you look up at stars in the night sky, youâ€™re seeing other stars in the Milky Way. If itâ€™s really dark, far away from lights from cities and houses, you can even see the dusty bands of the Milky Way stretch across the sky.
      
      
      </h2><img src="bootstarp/image/milky-way-over-mitten-park.en.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
      <p> Numbers and Sizes:
        There are estimated to be 200 billion to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe.
        Most galaxies range from 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light-years) in diameter.
        The space between galaxies contains a tenuous gas known as the intergalactic medium 1.
        So next time you gaze at the night sky, remember that each twinkling point of light could be a galaxyâ€”a cosmic tapestry woven across the vastness of space. ðŸŒŒâœ¨</p>
