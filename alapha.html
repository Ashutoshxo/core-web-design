  <h2>Alpha Centauri (α Centauri, α Cen, or Alpha Cen) is a triple star system in the southern constellation of Centaurus. It consists of three stars: Rigil Kentaurus (α Centauri A), Toliman (α Centauri B), and Proxima Centauri (α Centauri C).[14] Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at 4.2465 light-years (1.3020 pc).

    α Centauri A and B are Sun-like stars (class G and K, respectively) that together form the binary star system α Centauri AB. To the naked eye, these two main components appear to be a single star with an apparent magnitude of −0.27 . It is the brightest star in the constellation and the third-brightest in the night sky, outshone by only Sirius and Canopus.
    
    α Centauri A has 1.1 times the mass and 1.5 times the luminosity of the Sun, while α Centauri B is smaller and cooler, at 0.9 solar mass and less than 0.5 solar luminosity.[15] The pair orbit around a common centre with an orbital period of 79 years.[16] Their elliptical orbit is eccentric, so that the distance between A and B varies from 35.6 astronomical units (au), or about the distance between Pluto and the Sun, to 11.2 au, or about the distance between Saturn and the Sun.
    
    α Centauri C, or Proxima Centauri, is a small faint red dwarf (class M). Though not visible to the naked eye, Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at a distance of 4.24 ly (1.30 pc), slightly closer than α Centauri AB. Currently, the distance between Proxima Centauri and α Centauri AB is about 13,000 AU (0.21 ly),[17] equivalent to about 430 times the radius of Neptune's orbit.
    
    Proxima Centauri has two confirmed planets: Proxima b, an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone discovered in 2016, and Proxima d, a candidate sub-Earth which orbits very closely to the star, announced in 2022.[18] The existence of Proxima c, a mini-Neptune 1.5 au away discovered in 2019, is controversial.[19] α Centauri A may have a Neptune-sized planet in the habitable zone, though it is not yet known with certainty to be planetary in nature and could be an artifact of the discovery mechanism.[20] α Centauri B has no known planets: Planet α Cen Bb, purportedly discovered in 2012, was later disproven,[21] and no other planet has yet been confirmed.</h2>

    <h2>α Centauri (Latinised to Alpha Centauri) is the system's designation given by J. Bayer in 1603. It belongs to the constellation Centaurus, named after the half human, half horse creature in Greek mythology. Hercules accidentally wounded the centaur and placed him in the sky after his death. Alpha Centauri marks the right front hoof of the Centaur.[22] The common name Rigil Kentaurus is a Latinisation of the Arabic translation رجل القنطورس Rijl al-Qinṭūrus, meaning "the Foot of the Centaur".[23][24] Qinṭūrus is the Arabic transliteration of the Greek Κένταυρος (Kentaurus).[25] The name is frequently abbreviated to Rigil Kent or even Rigil, though the latter name is better known for Rigel (β Orionis).[26]

        An alternative name found in European sources, Toliman, is an approximation of the Arabic الظليمان aẓ-Ẓalīmān (in older transcription, aṭ-Ṭhalīmān), meaning 'the (two male) Ostriches', an appellation Zakariya al-Qazwini had applied to the pair of stars Lambda and Mu Sagittarii; it was often not clear on old star maps which name was intended to go with which star (or stars), and the referents changed over time.[27]</h2>
        <h3>A third name that has been used is Bungula (/ˈbʌŋɡjuːlə/). Its origin is not known, but it may have been coined from the Greek letter beta (β) and Latin ungula 'hoof', originally for Beta Centauri (the other hoof).[26]

            α Centauri C was discovered in 1915 by Robert T. A. Innes,[28] who suggested that it be named Proxima Centaurus,[29] from Latin 'the nearest [star] of Centaurus'.[30] The name Proxima Centauri later became more widely used and is now listed by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) as the approved proper name;[31][32] commonly, it is frequently abbreviated to Proxima.
            
            In 2016, the Working Group on Star Names of the IAU,[14] having decided to attribute proper names to individual component stars rather than to multiple systems,[33] approved the name Rigil Kentaurus (/ˈraɪdʒəl kɛnˈtɔːrəs/) as being restricted to α Centauri A and the name Proxima Centauri (/ˈprɒksɪmə sɛnˈtɔːraɪ/) for α Centauri C .[34] On 10 August 2018, the IAU approved the name Toliman (/ˈtɒlɪmæn/) for α Centauri B </h3>

                Alpha Centauri (α Centauri, α Cen, or Alpha Cen) is a triple star system in the southern constellation of Centaurus. It consists of three stars: Rigil Kentaurus (α Centauri A), Toliman (α Centauri B), and Proxima Centauri (α Centauri C).[14] Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun at 4.2465 light-years (1.3020 pc).

                Etymology and nomenclature
                α Centauri (Latinised to Alpha Centauri) is the system's designation given by J. Bayer in 1603. It belongs to the constellation Centaurus, named after the half human, half horse creature in Greek mythology. Hercules accidentally wounded the centaur and placed him in the sky after his death. Alpha Centauri marks the right front hoof of the Centaur.[22] The common name Rigil Kentaurus is a Latinisation of the Arabic translation رجل القنطورس Rijl al-Qinṭūrus, meaning "the Foot of the Centaur".[23][24] Qinṭūrus is the Arabic transliteration of the Greek Κένταυρος (Kentaurus).[25] The name is frequently abbreviated to Rigil Kent or even Rigil, though the latter name is better known for Rigel (β Orionis).[26]
                
                An alternative name found in European sources, Toliman, is an approximation of the Arabic الظليمان aẓ-Ẓalīmān (in older transcription, aṭ-Ṭhalīmān), meaning 'the (two male) Ostriches', an appellation Zakariya al-Qazwini had applied to the pair of stars Lambda and Mu Sagittarii; it was often not clear on old star maps which name was intended to go with which star (or stars), and the referents changed over time.[27]
                
                A third name that has been used is Bungula (/ˈbʌŋɡjuːlə/). Its origin is not known, but it may have been coined from the Greek letter beta (β) and Latin ungula 'hoof', originally for Beta Centauri (the other hoof).[26]
                
                α Centauri C was discovered in 1915 by Robert T. A. Innes,[28] who suggested that it be named Proxima Centaurus,[29] from Latin 'the nearest [star] of Centaurus'.[30] The name Proxima Centauri later became more widely used and is now listed by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) as the approved proper name;[31][32] commonly, it is frequently abbreviated to Proxima.
                
                In 2016, the Working Group on Star Names of the IAU,[14] having decided to attribute proper names to individual component stars rather than to multiple systems,[33] approved the name Rigil Kentaurus (/ˈraɪdʒəl kɛnˈtɔːrəs/) as being restricted to α Centauri A and the name Proxima Centauri (/ˈprɒksɪmə sɛnˈtɔːraɪ/) for α Centauri C .[34] On 10 August 2018, the IAU approved the name Toliman (/ˈtɒlɪmæn/) for α Centauri B .[35]
                
                Observation
                Alpha Centauri is located in 100x100Alpha Centauri
                Location of α Cen in Centaurus
                To the naked eye, α Centauri AB appears to be a single star, the brightest in the southern constellation of Centaurus.[36] Their apparent angular separation varies over about 80 years between 2 and 22 arcseconds (the naked eye has a resolution of 60 arcsec),[37] but through much of the orbit, both are easily resolved in binoculars or small telescopes.[38] At −0.27 apparent magnitude (combined for A and B magnitudes (see Apparent magnitude § Magnitude addition)), Alpha Centauri is a first-magnitude star and is fainter only than Sirius and Canopus.[36] It is the outer star of The Pointers or The Southern Pointers,[38] so called because the line through Beta Centauri (Hadar/Agena),[39] some 4.5° west,[38] points to the constellation Crux—the Southern Cross.[38] The Pointers easily distinguish the true Southern Cross from the fainter asterism known as the False Cross.[40]
                
                South of about 29° South latitude, α Cen is circumpolar and never sets below the horizon.[b] North of about 29° N latitude, Alpha Centauri never rises. Alpha Centauri lies close to the southern horizon when viewed from the 29° North latitude to the equator (close to Hermosillo and Chihuahua City in Mexico; Galveston, Texas; Ocala, Florida; and Lanzarote, the Canary Islands of Spain), but only for a short time around its culmination.[39] The star culminates each year at local midnight on 24 April and at local 9 p.m. on 8 June</h2>
