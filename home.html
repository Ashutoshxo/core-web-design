                          <p class="card-text">
                            When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? What is the nature of reality? Is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? In The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most illuminating scientific thinking about these and other abiding mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by brilliance and simplicity.
                            
                            According to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history. The authors explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the early universe and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. They conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a “theory of everything”: the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, which, if confirmed, would represent the ultimate triumph of human reason.
                             
                            A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">Galaxy’s Edge” by Amy Ratcliffe: While not a novel, this book provides a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World’s newest Star Wars lands. It’s a fascinating read for fans!
                            This isn’t nearly as exciting as an actual trip to Disneyland Resort or Walt Disney World, but it costs far less and offers a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the theme parks’ newest Star Wars lands. Written by pop culture expert and theme park aficionado, Amy Ratcliffe, this deluxe 256-page coffee table book displays the incredible portfolio of pre-visualization art that inspired the creation of the fictional world of Galaxy’s Edge and its bustling Black Spire Outpost on the Outer Rim planet of Batuu. 

“We looked back on work that happened over five years ago in some cases, but everyone recalled their thought processes and their excitement about working in the Star Wars galaxy,” Ratcliffe told Space.com. “I think readers will not only get an idea of the immense amount of work that went into developing such an ambitious land, but they’ll also see how much care and thoughtfulness went into it.” Walt Disney Imagineering’s trademark creative method comes alive using a constellation of vivid concept artworks, sketches, attraction blueprints, photos, and exclusive interviews with the talented team of Imagineers who helped construct the illusion of a life-size Star Wars trading destination.

                          <p class="card-text">“A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes” is a remarkable book on theoretical cosmology by the physicist Stephen Hawking. First published in 1988, it became a bestseller, selling more than 25 million copies worldwide. Here’s a glimpse of what it covers:

                            Hawking wrote this book for readers with no prior knowledge of physics.
                            It explores the structure, origin, development, and eventual fate of the Universe.
                            Topics include space, time, fundamental forces (like gravity), and cosmological phenomena (such as the Big Bang and black holes).

                            In later editions, Hawking discusses time travel and explores the possibility of wormholess.
                            He even considers a Universe without a quantum singularity at its beginning.

                          <p class="card-text">Stephen Hawking’s work on black holes has been groundbreaking. One of his most famous theorems, known as Hawking’s area theorem, has recently been confirmed using ripples in space-time caused by merging distant black holes. Let’s dive into the details
                            Hawking’s Area Theorem:
Derived in 1971 from Einstein’s theory of general relativity, this theorem states that the surface area of a black hole cannot decrease over time.
Why is this significant? It’s closely related to the second law of thermodynamics, which dictates that the entropy (or disorder) of a closed system must always increase.
Since a black hole’s entropy is proportional to its surface area, both must always increase togetherContradiction and New Physics:
Interestingly, the area law seems to contradict another of Hawking’s proven theorems: that black holes should evaporate over extremely long time scales.
Investigating this contradiction could lead to exciting discoveries in physics.
Remember, a black hole’s surface area is defined by the event horizon, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape

                          <p class="card-text">What happens to the big bang singularity within string theory? Did time have a beginning? These and other pre-eminent questions, whose implications go far beyond the boundaries of physics and even of science, lie at the forefront of today's research in theoretical particle physics and cosmology. Maurizio Gasperini succeeds in this book in drawing a thorough - yet very accessible and captivating - panorama of the various answers that have so far emerged to those basic questions, and of the cosmological observations which may soon allow a stringent test of our most advanced theoretical ideas.
